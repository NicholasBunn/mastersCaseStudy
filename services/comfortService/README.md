# **Process Vibration Service**

## **Description**
This service quantifies human comfort on maritime vessels according to SANS 2631-1. It offers a single service call.
- The 'Comfort Rating' call provides foresight for tactical decision-making by providing a comfort rating for a proposed route, based on estimated vibrations on board.

For information on the API design (calls and messages), check out the proto file at https://github.com/NicholasBunn/mastersCaseStudy/blob/main/services/comfortService/proto/v1/comfort_service_api_v1.proto
