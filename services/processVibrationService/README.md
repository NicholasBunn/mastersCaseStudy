# **Process Vibration Service**

## **Description**
This service processes process time-series vibration signals according to industry-accepted practices. It currently offers a single (somewhat anemic) service call to calculate the RMS of time-series acceleration data.

For information on the API design (calls and messages), check out the proto file at https://github.com/NicholasBunn/mastersCaseStudy/blob/main/services/processVibrationService/proto/v1/process_vibration_service_api_v1.proto
