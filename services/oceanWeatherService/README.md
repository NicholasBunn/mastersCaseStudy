# **Ocean Weather Service**

## **Description**
This service offers information about marine weather conditions. It offers two service calls, each serving a different temporal aspect (foresight and hindsight):
- The 'OceanWeatherPrediction' service call queries Stormglass's (https://stormglass.io/) API to fetch future weather conditions at specified latitudes and longitudes.
- The 'OceanWeatherHistory' service call allows the client to choose between querying the Stormglass API, Era5 dataset, or visual observations from the S.A. Agulhas to fetch historical weather conditions at specified latitudes and longitudes.

For information on the API design (calls and messages), check out the proto file at https://github.com/NicholasBunn/mastersCaseStudy/blob/main/services/oceanWeatherService/proto/v1/ocean_weather_service_api_v1.proto
