## **Description**

This directory is where all the protobuf/gRPC client and server code is generated to. Any services interested in consuming another service's API can get the relevant client code here.

## **Contributing**

This project forms part of my masters thesis, and as such collaboration is not currently offered. If you'd like to build on this project in your research, or get a bit more information on things feel free to drop me or either of my supervisors a message.

## **License**

I'm still investigating what licenses this project falls under. I suppose it's research output so it's governed by Stellenbosch University, but I've thrown it up here to help anyone who may be building on my work in future projects.
